Not a fancy project, this is just a simple adaptation from a YouTube video I saw, and adapted to my needs. The file is using only HTML and Javascript. 

For Javascript I'm using moment.js

In order for you to use this file, you will need to tell OBS to use a browser source, and point it to the file. On the source code, you will need to update the date and time to your own, so the timer can start. I will make some changes on the future to make it more user friendly, but for now, this is what I have.

I just want my Cantarell-font timer.
